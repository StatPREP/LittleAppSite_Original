title: "Activities with Little Apps"
---

<!--The [StatPREP.org](https://statprep.org) site has many resources for teaching statistics, including activities [specifically designed around the Little Apps](https://ecstatic-mclean-a0b3e0.netlify.app/categories/little-app/) -->

StatPREP instructors have written in-class activities keyed to the Little Apps on a variety of statistical topics. Explore them here:

- [Densities: common and rare](Activities/activity-common-and-rare.html)
- [Comparing confidence intervals](Activities/activity-comparing-confidence-intervals.html)
- [Shapes of distributions](Activities/activity-distribution-shapes.html)



We encourage instructors to send us a copy of activities that they write. Sharing such valuable resources helps make us all better teachers. We'll post any such contributions *via* this page.
