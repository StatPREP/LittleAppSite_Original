## DRAFT

The 2016 [GAISE report](https://www.amstat.org/asa/files/pdfs/GAISE/GaiseCollege_Full.pdf) provides guidelines for teaching introductory statistics that many instructors have found useful in updating their own courses.


1. Teach statistical thinking.
    a. Teach statistics as an investigative process problem-solving and decision-making.
    b. Give students experience with multivariable thinking.
2. Focus on conceptual understanding.
3. Integrate real data with a context and purpose.
4. Foster active learning.
5. Use technology to explore concepts and analyze data.
6. Use assessments to improve and evaluate student learning.

Every Little App involves selecting a data set and producing a random sample of selected variables from that data set. The sample will be graphed and summarized in various ways. The Little Apps make it easy to draw a new sample, allowing the user to quickly get an impression of the extent of sampling variability.
